# Independent Showings
    G46 Capstone Project - Jules Perryman
    July 2017


## Project Description:
Independent Showings is a full stack web app that allows Buyers who are looking for new home to schedule impromptu showings without requiring a licensed Realtor or agent to be present.

Prospective buyers must sign up and provide specific personal information which the App then validates, verifies and approves.

Once approved, they will have a unique showing id, which can be traced back to them and which they will use to set up showings with the Listing Broker of said property.

Real Estate Agents who wish to participate in this will also need to create a brief profile.

#### What problem does it solve?
>In the residential real estate market there is an inherent inefficiency in the buying process. Both Buyers and Agents are so often frustrated that both parties need to be present for any and all showings. This takes not only coordination of both parties schedules but also usually involves multiple trips and repeat visits.

> Almost invariably, Buyers who are in the process of searching for a new home, while driving around end up seeing a house and think "Oh that looks like a cool house, I'd love to see it."

> In order for them to see it, the current status quo, requires they need to contact their Agent, who in turn needs to contact the Listing's Showing Service, and the Showing Service then must contact the Seller's for approval, and then back back up the chain.

> Now, imagine if those same Buyers whom, in passing, noticed a house for sale _could_ simply call the Listing Agent and see it immediately!

> This app solves that gap. It alleviates the necessity for agents to always be present and streamlines the initial steps of the buying process. **GAME CHANGER**

#### Who has this problem?
> The consumers (_buyers_) and real estate Agents. As a licensed broker myself, I would love to not have to last minute in rush hour drive across town when my clients are already standing right out front! If they like it, I'll go back with them.

#### How will your project solve this problem?
> This will solve the aforementioned problem by creating the platform through which consumers, after having be approved, can set up showings independently with a licensed Agent.

> AND SELLER'S!
